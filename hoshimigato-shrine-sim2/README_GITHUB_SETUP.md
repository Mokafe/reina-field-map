# GitHub / Colab setup note

You can drop this entire folder (`hoshimigato-shrine-sim/`) into either repository:

- `Mokafe/reina-field-map` (recommended path: `/hoshimigato-shrine-sim`)
- `Mokafe/ginga-ml-uncertainty-public` (recommended path: `/hoshimigato-shrine-sim`)

Then open:

- `notebooks/00_quickstart_colab.ipynb`

In Colab, you can `git clone` the repo and `%cd` into this folder.

(If you want Colab badges, add them in your repo’s top README once you know the final path.)
